00:00:06,021 --> 00:00:07,261
Ah! [laughs]

3
00:00:07,341 --> 00:00:11,021
[Birk] That robber's daughter.
I see her in the forest sometimes.

4
00:00:11,101 --> 00:00:12,821
Stay away from her.

5
00:00:12,901 --> 00:00:14,381
[Mattis] They have to go.

6
00:00:14,461 --> 00:00:16,181
[Lovis] Winter is getting close.

7
00:00:16,261 --> 00:00:18,381
Instead of throwing them out,

8
00:00:18,461 --> 00:00:20,101
maybe you should shut them in.

9
00:00:20,701 --> 00:00:22,221
- [hissing]
- [explosion]

10
00:00:23,101 --> 00:00:25,261
The entrance's collapsed.
We can't get in or out.

11
00:00:25,341 --> 00:00:28,701
[Mattis] I'd like to see them carry
anything bigger than berries and mushrooms

12
00:00:28,781 --> 00:00:29,821
up that ladder.

13
00:00:29,901 --> 00:00:32,061
[Tjorm] It'll be
a long winter in Borka Keep.

14
00:00:32,141 --> 00:00:35,301
- So we'll never see them again?
- [Mattis] Never again.

15
00:00:36,021 --> 00:00:38,661
We need the merchants
and their carts untouched.

16
00:00:38,741 --> 00:00:41,261
[Cappa] I'll take charge of the soldiers.
It's an order from Valdir.

17
00:00:41,341 --> 00:00:43,381
Or rather, I demanded it,
she agreed to it.

18
00:00:43,461 --> 00:00:44,581
You will fail here.

19
00:00:44,661 --> 00:00:45,661
We'll see.

20
00:00:48,021 --> 00:00:50,101
[woman] I know, Flit, you're hungry.

21
00:00:50,181 --> 00:00:51,901
Uncle will find food today.

22
00:00:53,541 --> 00:00:54,821
Do you want to be one of us?

23
00:00:55,781 --> 00:00:56,901
Yes.

24
00:00:59,301 --> 00:01:01,501
Tell me, what goes on in Mattis Fortress?

25
00:01:06,381 --> 00:01:07,261
[door creaking]

26
00:01:07,341 --> 00:01:08,781
[Mattis] Prepare yourselves.

27
00:01:09,421 --> 00:01:10,501
Let's head out.

28
00:01:11,861 --> 00:01:13,261
Do you want to come with us?

29
00:01:13,341 --> 00:01:14,701
I won't go robbing, I told you.

30
00:01:14,781 --> 00:01:17,021
We're not going robbing,
we're going hunting.

31
00:01:18,461 --> 00:01:19,661
What are we hunting?

32
00:01:20,141 --> 00:01:23,021
I woke up this morning
with a craving for elk!

33
00:01:23,101 --> 00:01:24,621
[robbers laughing]

34
00:01:25,221 --> 00:01:26,181
Get dressed.

35
00:01:26,941 --> 00:01:30,701
[exciting music playing]

36
00:01:41,541 --> 00:01:43,581
[Mattis] They're mostly
out at dawn and dusk.

37
00:01:44,101 --> 00:01:46,981
And after the summer,
there are so many calves,

38
00:01:47,061 --> 00:01:49,261
they just wander around,
all over the place.

39
00:01:52,381 --> 00:01:54,141
Not right at this moment.

40
00:01:54,221 --> 00:01:55,501
But you just wait...

00:02:32,741 --> 00:02:33,861
Yeah!

[all continue cheering]

00:02:38,301 --> 00:02:39,301

[Skully-Per] A-ha!
I'm looking forward to this.

58
00:02:47,581 --> 00:02:51,701
The most tender parts are
for the toothless, everyone knows that.

59
00:02:51,781 --> 00:02:55,221

[dog whines]

64
00:03:15,901 --> 00:03:19,181
[Undis] So they've got elk
cooking in the Mattis Fortress?

65
00:03:19,261 --> 00:03:21,621
Why am I not cooking elk?

66
00:03:22,381 --> 00:03:25,701
Why have I got grain
and barley and peas and beans,

67
00:03:25,781 --> 00:03:27,381
while they're eating the best meat?

68
00:03:27,461 --> 00:03:28,741
I think you know why.

69
00:03:28,821 --> 00:03:31,861
Yes, it was a long time
since an elk run through this hall.

70
00:03:31,941 --> 00:03:35,861
That's what it would take
with you lazing around here all day.

71
00:03:35,941 --> 00:03:38,621
It was a long time
since I saw an elk climb a rope ladder.

72
00:03:38,701 --> 00:03:40,901
Yeah? Mm. What if
there were other animals?

73
00:03:40,981 --> 00:03:44,821
What if there were fish,
hares, squirrels, boars,

74
00:03:44,901 --> 00:03:47,781
pheasants, beavers, foxes,

75
00:03:47,861 --> 00:03:50,821
lynx, deers, badgers...

76
00:03:57,381 --> 00:03:58,941
Your mother isn't wrong.

77
00:03:59,021 --> 00:04:00,621
We need to fill our stores.

78
00:04:01,821 --> 00:04:03,101
There's snow in the air.

79
00:04:03,181 --> 00:04:04,381
[horse neighing]

80
00:04:04,461 --> 00:04:05,741
Soldiers! Get down.

[foreboding music playing]

83
00:04:29,341 --> 00:04:31,501
Be careful when
you're alone in the forest.

87
00:04:42,181 --> 00:04:43,181
Where are the horses?

00:04:43,261 --> 00:04:44,821

[man panting, grunting]

92
00:04:57,861 --> 00:04:59,221
What happened?

93
00:04:59,301 --> 00:05:01,421
They came and they took the horses.

94
00:05:02,941 --> 00:05:04,461
Those scoundrels.

95
00:05:05,101 --> 00:05:06,261
He left a message.

96
00:05:06,741 --> 00:05:07,901
What message?

97
00:05:10,021 --> 00:05:11,221
What message?

98
00:05:13,181 --> 00:05:15,261
He said that Mattis,

99
00:05:15,341 --> 00:05:18,141
the mightiest robbers' chief
in all the mountains and forests,

100
00:05:18,221 --> 00:05:20,301
has taken your horses, you...

101
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:21,661
"You" what?

102
00:05:24,261 --> 00:05:25,381
...fox's ass.

[Borka grunts]

104
00:05:28,421 --> 00:05:29,821
Those scoundrels.

00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:39,821
Oh, that was good.

[sheep bleating]

114
00:07:07,541 --> 00:07:08,381
Hi.

115
00:07:13,901 --> 00:07:15,101
[goat bleating]

116
00:07:18,941 --> 00:07:22,061
- [Ronja] Good morning, Chegge.
- Are you going out today too?

117
00:07:22,141 --> 00:07:24,021
Every day, as long as I can.

118
00:07:27,301 --> 00:07:29,941
Maybe you should stay
in the fortress a few days.

119
00:07:30,021 --> 00:07:31,181
Why would I do that?

120
00:07:31,261 --> 00:07:32,301
It's autumn.

121
00:07:33,061 --> 00:07:34,301
A lot can happen.

122
00:07:35,421 --> 00:07:37,381
I'm not afraid of anything in the forest.

123
00:07:37,461 --> 00:07:41,821
It gets dark early, wile-wings
and other wild things are out prowling.

124
00:07:41,901 --> 00:07:43,021
One eye to the sky.

125
00:07:43,101 --> 00:07:45,301
Maybe one to the bushes and brambles too.

126
00:07:47,541 --> 00:07:50,861
Mattis has a daughter
who spends a lot of time in the forest.

127
00:07:51,741 --> 00:07:53,381
Alone, out in the forest.

128
00:07:54,021 --> 00:07:55,701
The fortress is impenetrable,

129
00:07:55,781 --> 00:07:58,101
but if we take her,
Mattis will come to us.

130
00:07:58,181 --> 00:07:59,341
How old is she?

131
00:07:59,421 --> 00:08:01,821
Not old. Still a child.

132
00:08:01,901 --> 00:08:05,101
Why send three of us for one girl?

133
00:08:05,581 --> 00:08:08,061
She knows the forest. You do not.

134
00:08:09,141 --> 00:08:10,501
We'll return soon.

135
00:08:10,581 --> 00:08:12,581
[laughing]

136
00:08:13,661 --> 00:08:14,821
One child.

142
00:08:40,381 --> 00:08:41,901
Here you are again.

143
00:08:43,581 --> 00:08:46,581
I thought you'd want to watch out
for Borka robbers again today.

144
00:08:47,101 --> 00:08:48,181
You know what?

145
00:08:48,261 --> 00:08:50,101
That's just what I wanted.

146
00:08:50,821 --> 00:08:52,181
[chuckles]

147
00:08:53,021 --> 00:08:55,061
I thought I'd catch a horse today.

148
00:08:55,661 --> 00:08:57,421
Maybe we can help each other?

149
00:08:58,501 --> 00:09:01,021
I'm sure you'll be a big help.

150
00:09:01,101 --> 00:09:03,701
It might be easier if we work together.

151
00:09:04,661 --> 00:09:07,141
Then you need something to catch one with.

152
00:09:10,181 --> 00:09:13,381
[Birk] Lucky you just happened
to bring leather straps to the forest.

153
00:09:14,021 --> 00:09:15,061
Yeah, lucky.

154
00:09:15,741 --> 00:09:18,061
It's almost as if you're being nice to me.

155
00:09:19,861 --> 00:09:22,261
Don't get any ideas, Birk Borkason.

156
00:09:24,821 --> 00:09:28,061
I'm teaching you this
so you won't be completely useless.

157
00:09:29,101 --> 00:09:30,021
If you say so.

158
00:09:30,101 --> 00:09:30,941
I do.

159
00:09:32,941 --> 00:09:34,341
The smooth part should face out.

168
00:10:02,781 --> 00:10:03,781

00:10:48,941 --> 00:10:50,821
Scratch!

[screeching slowly fades]

182
00:11:04,301 --> 00:11:05,701
They weren't just chasing us.

183
00:11:05,781 --> 00:11:08,061
- What do you mean?
- The wile-wings.

184
00:11:10,741 --> 00:11:12,261
They were herding us forward.

185
00:11:12,341 --> 00:11:13,461
Why?

186
00:11:13,541 --> 00:11:14,981
I don't know.

187
00:11:15,061 --> 00:11:18,861
But if a wile-wing wants something
you should always do the opposite.

188
00:11:20,141 --> 00:11:21,861
[birds chirping]

189
00:11:25,461 --> 00:11:28,301
- [Ronja] Do you know where we are?
- [Birk] No.

190
00:11:29,301 --> 00:11:30,621
So we're lost?

191
00:11:31,741 --> 00:11:32,701
[Ronja] Yes.

192
00:11:33,381 --> 00:11:35,701
But only until we find the right path.

193
00:11:36,261 --> 00:11:37,341
[branches snapping]

194
00:11:37,421 --> 00:11:40,461
- [Birk] Have we found the right path yet?
- I don't think so.

195
00:11:42,261 --> 00:11:43,541
[Ronja] Let's try this way.

196
00:11:44,621 --> 00:11:45,941
Are you never scared?

197
00:11:46,541 --> 00:11:47,741
In the forest?

198
00:11:49,461 --> 00:11:50,301
No.

199
00:11:51,261 --> 00:11:53,501
I mean of... everything.

200
00:11:53,581 --> 00:11:55,381
You can't be scared of everything.

201
00:11:55,461 --> 00:11:57,981
But you know, not being good enough?

202
00:12:00,861 --> 00:12:01,941
No, never.

203
00:12:03,941 --> 00:12:05,101
Why, are you?

204
00:12:06,821 --> 00:12:07,861
Sometimes.

205
00:12:11,701 --> 00:12:13,621
Is it because I said you were useless?

206
00:12:13,701 --> 00:12:15,981
Because that was only
about catching horses.

207
00:12:17,061 --> 00:12:19,341
I haven't watched out for you enough

208
00:12:20,221 --> 00:12:21,821
to know about anything else.

209
00:12:32,381 --> 00:12:33,621
Goodbye then,

210
00:12:34,661 --> 00:12:35,701
robber's daughter.

211
00:12:36,941 --> 00:12:37,981
Goodbye,

212
00:12:39,221 --> 00:12:40,981
Birk Borkason.

213
00:13:05,781 --> 00:13:06,901
What are you doing?

214
00:13:06,981 --> 00:13:10,341
I was just going to check
how Oros is doing by the other path.

215
00:13:10,421 --> 00:13:12,541
Hurry up, then. Don't just stand there!

216
00:13:12,621 --> 00:13:14,421
If she comes now, she'll see us.

217
00:13:22,461 --> 00:13:23,901
[bird wings fluttering]

218
00:13:24,421 --> 00:13:25,541
[grunts]

219
00:13:28,741 --> 00:13:30,741
[whooshing sound]

220
00:13:34,141 --> 00:13:36,141
[ominous tone]

221
00:13:37,141 --> 00:13:38,261
[panting]

222
00:13:39,781 --> 00:13:40,901
[twigs snapping]

223
00:13:48,381 --> 00:13:49,741
[gasping]

224
00:14:03,541 --> 00:14:04,421
Ah...

225
00:14:09,861 --> 00:14:11,741
[twig snapping]

226
00:14:12,941 --> 00:14:14,621
Sorva. Sorva!

227
00:14:15,141 --> 00:14:16,061
[Ronja] Are you lost?

228
00:14:29,581 --> 00:14:31,261
[voice echoing] Are you lost?

229
00:14:32,381 --> 00:14:33,261
[panicked breathing]

230
00:14:33,341 --> 00:14:35,741
[screaming]

231
00:14:43,101 --> 00:14:44,301
Huh.

232
00:14:51,941 --> 00:14:54,101
There you are. I was worried.

233
00:14:54,181 --> 00:14:55,541
Is anyone else in the forest?

234
00:14:55,621 --> 00:14:57,941
No, just you. Everyone else is here.

235
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:02,061
- I heard someone screaming out there.
- Well, we're all here.

236
00:15:02,141 --> 00:15:03,301
Hmm.

237
00:15:03,381 --> 00:15:04,981
Maybe it was a Borka robber.

238
00:15:05,061 --> 00:15:07,021
Yeah, or soldiers, if we're lucky.

239
00:15:08,221 --> 00:15:10,701
Maybe you should stay in
a few days after all?

240
00:15:12,381 --> 00:15:13,381
Maybe.

241
00:15:13,461 --> 00:15:14,381
We'll see.

242
00:15:17,581 --> 00:15:19,021
[horse snorting]

243
00:15:19,661 --> 00:15:21,781
- Are they new horses?
- Yeah.

244
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:26,661
Where are they from?

245
00:15:26,741 --> 00:15:29,021
[Jutis] Well, they, uh...

246
00:15:31,261 --> 00:15:32,861
You know...

247
00:15:33,541 --> 00:15:36,861
You don't have to tell me.
I know, and I don't want to know.

248
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:41,421
[gentle flute music playing]

249
00:15:49,501 --> 00:15:51,861
So here you are, thinking.

250
00:15:51,941 --> 00:15:53,301
Here I am, thinking.

251
00:15:53,381 --> 00:15:54,501
[Skully-Per chuckles]

252
00:15:58,381 --> 00:16:01,421
What's it like in the forest these days?

253
00:16:01,501 --> 00:16:04,181
It's wild and free

254
00:16:05,301 --> 00:16:06,461
and lovely.

255
00:16:06,541 --> 00:16:07,941
[Skully-Per chucking]

256
00:16:09,221 --> 00:16:11,181
[clears throat] Mmm.

257
00:16:11,861 --> 00:16:13,901
[slurping]

258
00:16:15,661 --> 00:16:17,741
The wile-wings chased me today.

259
00:16:21,341 --> 00:16:24,301
They're at their most dangerous in autumn.

260
00:16:24,381 --> 00:16:27,341
Their young ones
have to learn how to hunt,

261
00:16:27,421 --> 00:16:30,501
so they take what they've caught,
let it loose,

262
00:16:30,581 --> 00:16:34,381
and let their young chase it
through the dark tunnels.

263
00:16:35,221 --> 00:16:37,261
What do they do when they catch you?

264
00:16:38,741 --> 00:16:41,661
Oh, what a wile-wing does.

265
00:16:41,741 --> 00:16:43,101
Mmm.

266
00:16:43,181 --> 00:16:46,381
Lots of hungry little teeth

267
00:16:46,461 --> 00:16:50,741
and sharp claws, scratching and tearing.

268
00:16:54,261 --> 00:16:57,301
I think that they were
trying to herd me somewhere today.

269
00:16:57,781 --> 00:17:01,981
If a wile-wing wants something,
you should always do the opposite.

270
00:17:02,821 --> 00:17:04,021
That's what I said.

271
00:17:05,581 --> 00:17:06,461
To who?

272
00:17:08,341 --> 00:17:09,781
To... to myself.

273
00:17:09,861 --> 00:17:15,701
I thought maybe you'd made friends
with some friendly fox out there.

274
00:17:17,021 --> 00:17:18,461
Why did you think that?

275
00:17:18,541 --> 00:17:20,941
You've got a hair on your shoulder.

276
00:17:21,021 --> 00:17:22,141
[chuckles]

277
00:17:22,221 --> 00:17:25,141
From a fox tail, perhaps, I thought...

278
00:17:27,261 --> 00:17:29,581
Your old eyes cannot be trusted.

279
00:17:29,661 --> 00:17:32,221
They see more than you might think.

280
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:35,581
[Skully-Per chuckles]

281
00:17:41,221 --> 00:17:42,501
Have they returned?

282
00:17:44,381 --> 00:17:46,581
Maybe she wasn't in the forest today.

283
00:17:48,101 --> 00:17:50,141
Wouldn't they have returned without her?

284
00:17:50,221 --> 00:17:51,501
They were very cocky.

285
00:17:51,581 --> 00:17:54,261
Maybe they're embarrassed
to come back empty-handed.

286
00:17:54,781 --> 00:17:55,621
No.

287
00:17:56,861 --> 00:17:58,581
Something happened to them.

288
00:17:58,661 --> 00:18:00,661
We'll send three more,
first thing tomorrow.

289
00:18:04,181 --> 00:18:06,461
- We've done this a while now.
- Mm-hmm.

290
00:18:08,261 --> 00:18:09,901
What's different about this time?

291
00:18:11,181 --> 00:18:12,101
Nothing.

292
00:18:13,981 --> 00:18:15,301
They're just a little smarter.

293
00:18:16,061 --> 00:18:17,381
Harder to catch.

294
00:18:17,941 --> 00:18:20,301
But it's still just an assignment?

295
00:18:20,381 --> 00:18:21,861
What else would it be?

296
00:18:23,821 --> 00:18:24,821
I don't know.

297
00:18:25,301 --> 00:18:27,821
It's just an assignment, like all others.

298
00:18:30,181 --> 00:18:32,581
- Where are you going?
- To check on the horses.

299
00:18:35,181 --> 00:18:36,661
[horse snorting]

300
00:18:39,061 --> 00:18:40,941
[dog barking in distance]

301
00:18:45,421 --> 00:18:46,461
Hey.

302
00:18:46,541 --> 00:18:47,861
[horse snorts]

303
00:18:55,661 --> 00:18:58,181
[mysterious music playing]

304
00:18:59,181 --> 00:19:01,261
[man] What is your horse's name?

305
00:19:01,341 --> 00:19:04,261
Tell me your horse's name,
then you can ride home.

306
00:19:04,341 --> 00:19:05,501
[horse snorts]

307
00:19:08,501 --> 00:19:11,781
I'm starting to lose my patience.
Tell me the horse's name.

308
00:19:27,741 --> 00:19:28,741
[music fades]

309
00:19:33,901 --> 00:19:35,221
This was Skidas'.

310
00:19:37,141 --> 00:19:38,461
What happened?

311
00:19:38,541 --> 00:19:39,541
Who knows?

312
00:19:40,101 --> 00:19:42,941
Wile-wings, gray dwarves,
the underearthers...

313
00:19:43,621 --> 00:19:45,461
All kinds of creatures
are out before winter.

314
00:19:45,541 --> 00:19:47,621
Someone from here would have known that.

315
00:19:47,701 --> 00:19:51,261
Skidas, Sorva or Oros,
were none of them from here?

316
00:19:51,341 --> 00:19:52,861
All three of them.

317
00:19:53,421 --> 00:19:56,861
Well, they laughed
and said how easy it would be.

318
00:19:56,941 --> 00:19:59,661
They thought it was
unnecessary to send three.

319
00:19:59,741 --> 00:20:02,541
Someone from here
would've known that was all talk.

320
00:20:03,941 --> 00:20:05,861
Is that what soldiers from here are?

321
00:20:06,701 --> 00:20:07,741
All talk?

322
00:20:13,461 --> 00:20:16,941
How many of you does it take
to get a child from the forest?

323
00:20:17,021 --> 00:20:18,821
I don't think anyone will do it now.

324
00:20:18,901 --> 00:20:20,261
- [Cappa] You don't think so?
- No.

325
00:20:20,981 --> 00:20:23,381
Then you are of no use to me, are you?

326
00:20:24,421 --> 00:20:25,661
Away with you.

327
00:20:32,461 --> 00:20:34,141
[sheep bleating]

328
00:20:36,541 --> 00:20:38,541
[indistinct chattering]

329
00:20:39,781 --> 00:20:40,901
Have you heard?

330
00:20:42,901 --> 00:20:44,341
Skidas and the others, yes.

331
00:20:45,061 --> 00:20:47,821
- Is that what they're talking about?
- Mm.

332
00:20:52,861 --> 00:20:55,781
Was she with them in the forest,
our new bailiff?

333
00:20:55,861 --> 00:20:58,221
- No.
- No. So she sent them to die.

334
00:21:02,021 --> 00:21:03,661
You're welcome to spread that.

335
00:21:04,821 --> 00:21:07,781
It might remind people
that all she's done so far

336
00:21:07,861 --> 00:21:10,701
is catch a simple thief, who she released.

337
00:21:13,181 --> 00:21:16,141
Who knows, maybe he
killed Skidas and the others.

338
00:21:16,221 --> 00:21:17,181
No.

339
00:21:18,261 --> 00:21:20,341
Whatever did, it wasn't human.

340
00:21:20,421 --> 00:21:22,821
Look, we know that. They don't.

341
00:21:23,901 --> 00:21:28,061
I just think we'd all be happier
if she spent the winter somewhere else.

342
00:21:29,861 --> 00:21:31,261
Just being considerate?

343
00:21:32,101 --> 00:21:33,581
Just being considerate.

344
00:21:46,741 --> 00:21:49,301
[melancholy music playing]

345
00:21:50,741 --> 00:21:52,381
[dog barking]

346
00:22:06,461 --> 00:22:08,381
What would you've done
if the Mattis robbers

347
00:22:08,461 --> 00:22:10,261
hadn't come to the village
and seen Chegge?

348
00:22:12,301 --> 00:22:14,501
He would have had to sit there for longer.

349
00:22:16,141 --> 00:22:17,101
How long?

350
00:22:17,781 --> 00:22:19,141
Until they saw him.

351
00:22:26,701 --> 00:22:29,941
I don't know what it is,
but this place is not good for us.

352
00:22:32,741 --> 00:22:33,781
For you.

353
00:22:37,781 --> 00:22:40,621
We haven't been paid,
we can just leave, take some easy--

354
00:22:40,701 --> 00:22:43,061
No. No, I have to finish this first.

355
00:22:43,821 --> 00:22:44,981
But why?

356
00:22:46,221 --> 00:22:48,861
I've known my entire life
that I'd end up back here.

357
00:22:48,941 --> 00:22:50,061
"Back here?"

358
00:22:52,061 --> 00:22:53,341
I want to be alone.

359
00:22:58,101 --> 00:22:59,461
[knocking on door]

360
00:22:59,541 --> 00:23:00,741
[window squeaking]

361
00:23:00,821 --> 00:23:02,181
I don't know if you heard,

362
00:23:02,261 --> 00:23:04,581
but your overrated bailiff
has failed again.

363
00:23:12,341 --> 00:23:15,341
She can't even get the soldiers
to go to the forest anymore.

364
00:23:16,421 --> 00:23:19,381
She's costing us.
Food and money that we need.

365
00:23:19,461 --> 00:23:21,461
I can't just cancel our agreement.

366
00:23:23,501 --> 00:23:25,261
What do we really know about her?

367
00:23:25,781 --> 00:23:27,741
Those robber bands she's caught,

368
00:23:27,821 --> 00:23:28,821
who were they?

369
00:23:28,901 --> 00:23:30,861
She has an excellent reputation.

370
00:23:30,941 --> 00:23:32,701
Yes, but how do you know it's true?

371
00:23:35,101 --> 00:23:37,221
This is just because she took your place.

372
00:23:37,301 --> 00:23:39,181
No, you gave her my place.

373
00:23:42,661 --> 00:23:44,101
It was given to her.

374
00:23:44,181 --> 00:23:47,021
Halvert, I have complete trust in her.

375
00:23:48,861 --> 00:23:50,941
Three soldiers died yesterday.

376
00:23:51,021 --> 00:23:52,861
People are talking.

377
00:23:52,941 --> 00:23:55,141
She's caught no robbers,
but she's to live here,

378
00:23:55,221 --> 00:23:56,981
burning our wood, eating our food.

379
00:23:57,061 --> 00:23:58,901
Winter is on its way.

380
00:24:00,341 --> 00:24:01,301
[glass bangs on table]

381
00:24:02,101 --> 00:24:04,021
People will starve, we know that.

382
00:24:05,261 --> 00:24:06,501
Then they'll be angry.

383
00:24:07,541 --> 00:24:10,061
At her, but also at the one
who brought her here.

384
00:24:10,141 --> 00:24:11,901
So what do you suggest?

385
00:24:15,661 --> 00:24:19,061
I'll deal with at least one of the robber
bands to become lawman again.

386
00:24:19,141 --> 00:24:21,101
She goes. Without pay.

387
00:24:21,181 --> 00:24:22,101
[sighs]

388
00:24:22,181 --> 00:24:24,101
You'll deal with one of the robber bands?

389
00:24:25,421 --> 00:24:26,661
Before winter.

390
00:24:27,221 --> 00:24:28,141
Now.

391
00:24:29,101 --> 00:24:29,981
[chuckles]

392
00:24:51,461 --> 00:24:52,501
Where is she?

393
00:24:53,021 --> 00:24:54,301
In the fortress.

394
00:24:54,381 --> 00:24:57,021
I need her out. We're short on time.

395
00:24:57,541 --> 00:24:59,621
It's not my fault you didn't get her.

396
00:25:01,021 --> 00:25:02,661
You're not trying to trick me?

397
00:25:02,741 --> 00:25:05,021
No. She won't go anywhere with me.

398
00:25:05,101 --> 00:25:06,381
Why not?

399
00:25:06,461 --> 00:25:08,461
I'm new, no one trusts me yet.

400
00:25:10,341 --> 00:25:11,901
Here's a little reminder.

401
00:25:13,741 --> 00:25:17,741
Help me, and I'll make sure
your sister and nephew get through winter.

402
00:25:17,821 --> 00:25:20,781
Stab me in the back,
and I'll exile them too.

403
00:25:21,381 --> 00:25:24,221
Get the girl out before winter.

404
00:25:24,821 --> 00:25:25,941
[pats shoulder]

405
00:25:55,901 --> 00:25:57,941
[bird cawing]

406
00:26:09,941 --> 00:26:11,501
[wings flapping]

00:26:20,341 --> 00:26:22,381
[dramatic music playing]

410
00:26:24,821 --> 00:26:29,541
[screeching]

411
00:26:37,381 --> 00:26:38,901
[screeching]

412
00:26:40,381 --> 00:26:41,661
[Halvert grunting]

413
00:26:45,541 --> 00:26:46,861

[melancholy music playing]

417
00:27:23,661 --> 00:27:24,621
[sighs]

418
00:27:42,181 --> 00:27:43,421
Ah...

419
00:27:59,501 --> 00:28:00,501
Pelye!

420
00:28:00,581 --> 00:28:01,861
It's snowing!

421
00:28:01,941 --> 00:28:03,741
[Pelye laughs]

422
00:28:07,501 --> 00:28:08,421
Lovis!

423
00:28:10,741 --> 00:28:11,821
It's snowing.

424
00:28:13,021 --> 00:28:14,061
Where are my skis?

425
00:28:14,781 --> 00:28:16,621
My hat and my gloves?

426
00:28:18,861 --> 00:28:20,501
What are you saying?

427
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:24,021
[Ronja] It's snowing.

428
00:28:24,101 --> 00:28:26,421
[ominous music playing]

429
00:28:26,501 --> 00:28:27,701
[Ronja] Winter is here.

430
00:28:30,021 --> 00:28:32,021
My winter clothes, where are they?

431
00:28:33,341 --> 00:28:36,221
[Lovis] The first snow
can disappear as fast as it came.

432
00:28:38,061 --> 00:28:41,421
[Ronja] But it can also be a fathom deep,
and then I have to be ready.

433
00:28:41,501 --> 00:28:45,021
[Lovis] Calm down.
First you're eating some soup.

434
00:28:45,101 --> 00:28:49,741
[dramatic music playing]

435
00:29:01,661 --> 00:29:03,101
[inhales deeply]

436
00:29:09,901 --> 00:29:11,541
[man] You can't trust any of them.

437
00:29:12,061 --> 00:29:15,421
They pretend to be your friend
so they can stab you in the back.

438
00:29:15,501 --> 00:29:17,381
- Not Borka.
- All of them!

439
00:29:17,461 --> 00:29:20,981
You won't see him again.
And if you do you'll be sorry.

440
00:29:41,821 --> 00:29:43,621
[music fades]

441
00:29:43,701 --> 00:29:44,861
It's snowing.

442
00:29:47,781 --> 00:29:48,901
It's snowing.

443
00:29:53,741 --> 00:29:55,661
[stones rattling]

444
00:30:11,701 --> 00:30:15,381

449
00:30:30,581 --> 00:30:33,181
Ah! [grunts]

450
00:30:34,901 --> 00:30:37,021
[heavy footsteps approaching]

[wile-wing hissing]

453
00:30:50,501 --> 00:30:52,621
[whimpering] No. No. Please.

454
00:30:53,141 --> 00:30:55,261
Please... [breathing shakily]

455
00:30:55,341 --> 00:30:56,341
[hissing]

456
00:30:56,421 --> 00:30:58,901
[Halvert whimpering] No, please.

457
00:30:58,981 --> 00:30:59,941
Please!

458
00:31:00,021 --> 00:31:01,261
[sobbing]

459
00:31:04,741 --> 00:31:06,861

[wile-wing screeching]

00:31:17,141 --> 00:31:19,261
- [wings flapping]
- [Halvert groaning]

[Halvert screaming]

475
00:31:59,501 --> 00:32:00,901
Ronja, be careful.

476
00:32:00,981 --> 00:32:02,741
Skis have a will of their own.

477
00:32:02,821 --> 00:32:04,101
Is that right?

478
00:32:04,181 --> 00:32:05,781
[Mattis] And the snow is cold.

479
00:32:05,861 --> 00:32:07,101
And... and the cold,

480
00:32:07,181 --> 00:32:08,701
the cold is also cold.

481
00:32:08,781 --> 00:32:09,901
[Ronja] Bye, Mattis.

482
00:32:10,461 --> 00:32:11,541
One eye to the sky.

483
00:32:11,621 --> 00:32:12,941
One eye to the sky.

484
00:32:13,821 --> 00:32:16,821
She'd better take care.
If anything happens to her...

485
00:32:17,821 --> 00:32:21,141
She can look after herself
better than any robber.

486
00:32:22,221 --> 00:32:23,821
But snow is snow.

487
00:32:24,661 --> 00:32:27,381
She's never been in the forest
with the snow before.

488
00:32:28,461 --> 00:32:29,461
[kisses]

489
00:32:41,021 --> 00:32:43,661

[music fades]

491
00:33:30,101 --> 00:33:31,821
Is that all you bring home?

492
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:34,861
It's hard with horses.

493
00:33:35,821 --> 00:33:37,741
Without horses it's hopeless.

494
00:33:38,261 --> 00:33:39,621
Winter has just begun.

495
00:33:40,821 --> 00:33:41,661
I know.

496
00:33:43,661 --> 00:33:44,581
I know that.

497
00:33:48,061 --> 00:33:50,061
[lute playing]

498
00:34:00,501 --> 00:34:02,821

- [snoring]

[snoring]

501
00:34:07,341 --> 00:34:09,701
[Ronja] There was a hump
in the middle of the slope

502
00:34:09,781 --> 00:34:10,901
and I jumped it!

503
00:34:11,501 --> 00:34:14,861
A long way. It was as if I was flying!

504
00:34:26,621 --> 00:34:28,301
Why don't you like the snow?

505
00:34:29,741 --> 00:34:31,941
I have bad memories of the first snow.

506
00:34:32,941 --> 00:34:34,101
What memories?

507
00:34:34,981 --> 00:34:36,061
Just memories.

508
00:34:37,101 --> 00:34:38,061
From when?

509
00:34:40,141 --> 00:34:41,581
From when I was your age.

510
00:34:43,421 --> 00:34:44,501
What happened?

511
00:34:50,941 --> 00:34:53,301
Bad memories should be kept to oneself.

512
00:35:02,101 --> 00:35:03,181
I want to know.

513
00:35:06,101 --> 00:35:07,341
Maybe when you're older.

514
00:35:12,101 --> 00:35:14,101
[woman vocalizing softly]

515
00:35:16,221 --> 00:35:18,941
[wind whistling]

516
00:35:34,021 --> 00:35:36,101
[chickens clucking]

517
00:35:38,181 --> 00:35:39,901
[indistinct chattering]

518
00:35:42,661 --> 00:35:45,141
They're already collecting
from the communal stores.

519
00:35:45,781 --> 00:35:48,421
Yes, they're already collecting.

520
00:35:50,581 --> 00:35:52,301
I haven't seen Halvert in a while.

521
00:35:53,181 --> 00:35:54,621
He went after the robbers.

522
00:35:55,301 --> 00:35:57,701
To catch them and then kick me out?

523
00:35:57,781 --> 00:35:59,261
Yes, that was the idea.

524
00:36:00,741 --> 00:36:04,581
Did you know he was hiding food
and stolen goods from the Borka cave?

525
00:36:04,661 --> 00:36:08,381
He gave it to the merchant who was here,
and they split the profits.

526
00:36:08,461 --> 00:36:10,101
No, I didn't know that.

527
00:36:12,261 --> 00:36:15,061
I have a feeling he won't be coming back.

528
00:36:17,421 --> 00:36:18,901
We'll get them in spring.

529
00:36:20,461 --> 00:36:24,421
Before then we have
a long, hard winter ahead of us.

530
00:36:29,221 --> 00:36:30,341
Why are you doing this?

531
00:36:31,461 --> 00:36:33,861
- You don't think we should help her?
- Yes...

532
00:36:35,501 --> 00:36:37,061
It's just unlike you.

533
00:36:38,741 --> 00:36:40,061
Take it to her.

534
00:37:12,701 --> 00:37:13,661
Good day.

535
00:37:14,981 --> 00:37:17,781
- My name is Smavis and I'm--
- I know who you are.

536
00:37:18,741 --> 00:37:19,821
What do you want?

537
00:37:19,901 --> 00:37:21,661
[Flit crying]

538
00:37:22,821 --> 00:37:24,701
Why are you giving us this?

539
00:37:26,061 --> 00:37:26,941
You need it.

540
00:37:28,181 --> 00:37:30,541
Because your sister exiled my brother.

541
00:37:30,621 --> 00:37:33,501
My sister doesn't write the rules,
she just enforces them.

542
00:37:34,181 --> 00:37:35,141
He stole.

543
00:37:35,221 --> 00:37:36,501
To give us food.

544
00:37:38,981 --> 00:37:40,581
I think she sees herself in you.

545
00:37:40,661 --> 00:37:42,621
Looking after a child, alone.

546
00:37:44,301 --> 00:37:46,261
- She has children?
- [chuckles] No.

547
00:37:47,541 --> 00:37:50,181
But she raised me alone,
since we were children.

548
00:37:51,541 --> 00:37:53,981
- What happened to your parents?
- They died.

549
00:37:55,581 --> 00:37:56,821
When I was three.

550
00:37:57,981 --> 00:37:59,101
Give her my thanks.

551
00:38:01,301 --> 00:38:02,421
I'll be back.

552
00:38:02,501 --> 00:38:03,581
You're welcome.

553
00:38:03,661 --> 00:38:05,501
[crying]

554
00:38:12,661 --> 00:38:16,701
Ha! [laughs]

555
00:38:16,781 --> 00:38:19,101
Oh! Oh!

556
00:38:26,101 --> 00:38:28,061
[joyous flute music playing]

557
00:38:40,381 --> 00:38:41,381
Ah!

558
00:38:42,941 --> 00:38:44,541
[yells]

559
00:38:45,461 --> 00:38:46,861
[Ronja] Ah.

560
00:38:46,941 --> 00:38:47,781
Whoo!

561
00:38:48,701 --> 00:38:49,901
[grunting]

562
00:38:49,981 --> 00:38:52,021
[continues grunting]

563
00:38:53,301 --> 00:38:55,701
[grunts, sighs]

564
00:38:55,781 --> 00:38:57,541
[laughs uncertainly]

565
00:38:57,621 --> 00:38:58,461

566
00:38:58,541 --> 00:39:01,621

[grunting]

568
00:39:05,941 --> 00:39:06,861
[grunts loudly]

569
00:39:08,261 --> 00:39:09,181
Oh.

570
00:39:09,261 --> 00:39:12,781
[chattering]

571
00:39:12,861 --> 00:39:15,181
Why... why is she doing that?

572
00:39:15,261 --> 00:39:17,501
Breaking the roof. Uh, why?

573
00:39:17,581 --> 00:39:20,381
I couldn't help it.
It... it was an accident.

574
00:39:20,461 --> 00:39:23,181
Shoe right through the roof. Why?

575
00:39:24,901 --> 00:39:27,341
Roof is broken, in with the snow.

576
00:39:27,421 --> 00:39:29,101
Why is she doing this?

577
00:39:29,821 --> 00:39:33,861
If you help me get free,
I'll help you fix the roof.

578
00:39:33,941 --> 00:39:36,181
She's stuck in the roof.

579
00:39:36,261 --> 00:39:37,701
Why is she doing that?

580
00:39:38,301 --> 00:39:39,821
Are you going to help me?

581
00:39:40,421 --> 00:39:41,261
Why?

582
00:39:41,821 --> 00:39:44,381
Little boy, into the cradle.

583
00:39:46,941 --> 00:39:48,741
That's a good spot for him to hang.

584
00:39:48,821 --> 00:39:49,741
Can you...

585
00:39:49,821 --> 00:39:52,181
Little boy. She's rocking him.

586
00:39:52,261 --> 00:39:53,421
[Ronja groans]

587
00:39:53,501 --> 00:39:56,021
[rump-goblins] Why? Why? Why

588
00:39:56,101 --> 00:39:59,341
- Why? Why? Why?
- Why? Why? Why?

589
00:39:59,421 --> 00:40:01,141
Stop why-ing!

590
00:40:02,101 --> 00:40:03,261

[muttering indistinctly]

594
00:40:13,141 --> 00:40:14,541
Just help me.

595
00:40:16,141 --> 00:40:17,021
Ugh!

596
00:40:17,101 --> 00:40:18,501
Help!

597
00:40:18,981 --> 00:40:20,501
Help me!

- [snarling]
- [gasps]

613
00:41:49,021 --> 00:41:53,941
Pretty little human.
